🫴Practice-page2

This repository contains small practice projects I built while learning HTML, CSS, and basic web design.
These projects are inspired by freeCodeCamp exercises and are meant to improve my coding skills.

📂 Project Structure

Inside the practice-page-2 folder, you will find:

• photo-gallery:

A responsive photo gallery layout created with HTML and CSS.

• rothko-painting:

A simple CSS art project that recreates a Rothko-style painting using div elements and colors.

🛠️ Technologies Used

• HTML5

• CSS3

🎯 Why I Made This

Because you can’t become good at coding without getting your hands dirty.
This folder is basically my HTML + CSS gym — minus the sweat, plus the caffeine. ☕
